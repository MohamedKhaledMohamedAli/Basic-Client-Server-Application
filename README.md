# Basic-Client-Server-Application
Developed a Server and Client communication system using the TCP protocol.

Utilized Qt with C++ to implement the Server and Client, employing QTcpSocket and QTcpServer classes to enable bidirectional data transfer between the client and server. A user-friendly GUI was designed, allowing users to specify the IP address and port number for the connection.
